Build, Train and Optimize Convolutional Neural Network to Detect the Flower Name by Processing the Input Flower Image


Install tensorflow and keras on Google Colab notebook
Load flower image dataset having 6 different flowers images.
Use matplotlib to print the random images from the dataset along with their names as labels.
Encode the categorical data and perform pixel scaling on the input images to reduce the size of the input data.
Perform Test-Train split.
Design a Convolutional Neural Network with the Pooling and Flattening layers to detect the type of flower in the input image and classify it using the softmax layer.
Compile the model and print the model summary.
Fit the model on the train dataset and print the model accuracy with the test dataset.
Plot the graph for both the loss and accuracy for the test and train dataset.
Perform model tuning and data augmentation to avoid overfitting.
 Optimize the design of your CNN to achieve higher accuracy.
Print the predicted results using matplotlib
